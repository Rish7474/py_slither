py_slither: offline snake game

features:
1) snake game with GUI
2) A database to local high score
3) Firebase website to store top 10 high scores
4) Autononous mode

High Score Calculation:
# of food - (time taken to eat * # of food) 

autonomous mode will most likely use a pathfinding alogrithm where the head
of the snake is the start point, the food is the end point, and the rest of the snake is the obstacle
